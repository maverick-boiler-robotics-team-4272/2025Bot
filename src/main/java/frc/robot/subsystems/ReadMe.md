# Subsystem Spec
## An Overview
This document serves to explain the basic functionally of each subsytem. 

This spec is a living breathing document. Much like Doctor Frankestiens monster, at times it's going to be scared, confused, and a little ugly. Treat it kindly, and it will love you like a Father. Descriptions will update as robot design decisions (both design and programmatically) are made. Please let us know if there is anything that seems out of date or inaccurate.

This does not describe how each subsystem internally algorithms work. That will be done in a different location. It simply discusses what each subsystem is meant to do, it's states are, and what mechanical motors/pneumatics/sensors it has.

Thanks!
